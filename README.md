## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

## WITHOUT ANDROID / POJO TESTING
Run `gradle run` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4567/`. The app will not automatically change if you make any changes white the app is still live. A rerun of the command will b needed in this case.

## Code scaffolding(POJO)
Run `netstat -pliten |grep java` to check for ports that are being used by java processes. You can also use `gradle run|build`.

## Build

Run `gradle build` to build the project. The `build.gradle` file is important for any of the required process dependencies to function properly.

## Running unit tests

Run `run test` to execute the unit tests on your local directory after git cloning or downloading. Tests also include robolectric.
